# EMETRICS for Python

emetrics is a project that is supposed to bring econometric and statistical learning methods to python.
It is still under development and will always stay under development since it is supposed to represent my knowledge. At times and especially now at the beginning it does not really represent my knowledge but I hope to be able to catch up and get coding soon.

## Plans
Like mentioned above emetrics is supposed to bring econometric and statistical learning techniques to python in an as simple as possible way. That means, the package will not just be able to apply those methods but it will also be self-contained in so far that it will have detailed explanations about each of the methods. That will make the development slower. I believe, however, that a one-stop solution such as this here can be really helpful since it then can even be employed on airgapped systems one might encounter when working with sensitive data. Next to this I also want to implement an easy-dev-and-test kind off style that immidately checks all the assumptions of a model (as long as it is possible) when the user employs a mothod. That way the user gets an immidiate worning when something is wrong.

## Quick Exploration
At a later stage I hope to be able to implement a quick exploration method that when called will explore the data automatically and develop a report that (if requested by the user) even contains suggestions for methods (if such suggestions can be derived from the data alone).
