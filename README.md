# Project: EMetrics

## What is is all about?

The EMetrics project is all about programming a library that enables state-of-the-art econometric analysis. This immediately also implies that it can be used for data science puposes. 

The project is still at its beginnings and is so far more a way for me to deepen my knowledge about econometrics, statistical learning, and data science. It is also supposed to be my playground to test out new things I learn. I will therefor try to include and example (usually an economic or financial example) for every method included in this library.

## Which programming language will be used?

For now I have decided to use R. The reason for this is that in many school applications and case days I am required to use R. Once the R project is matured I will consider to translate the project also into python so that it can also be used in companies/teams that prefer python over R; which seems to be the majority outside academia and traditional data analysis and statistics.

## Who am I?

I am an Econometrics and Operations Research BSc. student at a dutch university.
